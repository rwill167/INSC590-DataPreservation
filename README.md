# Data Preservation Project
This is [Rhiannon Williams](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3772-9036)'s submission for the Data Preservation Project in INSC590.

## Data Source
The data shows the number of Tuberculosis cases reported in each state and region in the US in 2018. This excludes data from US territories. 

This file is from the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS), part of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States. This file was found via the [Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nndss-table-iii-tuberculosis-1a6ba) repository and is open for public access and use.

## Reproducibility
The data was compiled by the Division of STD Prevention, National Center HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, and the NNDSS. The data gathered for the NNDSS is published in the [Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report]([https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/publications/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/publications/index.html)). The data was gathered from reports sent from territory and state health departments to the CDC. 

As mentioned by the NNDSS, "Notifiable disease reporting is likely incomplete, and the completeness varies depending upon the disease and the reporting state or territory. The recognition of a disease and degree of completeness may be influenced by the availability of diagnostic facilities; control measures in effect; public awareness of a specific disease; and the interests, resources, and priorities of state and local health officials responsible for disease control and public health surveillance." ([source]([https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesSurveillanceData20100927.pdf](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesSurveillanceData20100927.pdf)))

While the data published in the weekly report is timely and provisional, the data included in the dataset for this project is considered finalized once published in the MMWR Summary of Notifiable Disease--United States.

There is currently no way to reproduce this data due to the complex nature of reporting and collecting the data.
